## Executive Summary

With the excitement surrounding the integration of AI into every aspect of life, it's crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the areas where AI has significantly contributed to fundamental scientific research, as well as identifying gaps that remain unexplored. To address this, we've created an AI playground, a zoo of models—an accessible and interactive resource. With just a few clicks, you can gain a holistic view of AI's impact across various topics and experiment with each model to discover how truly beneficial they are.

Currently, 69 papers/models are hosted, mostly from Nature Portfolio journals in 2024 according to a selection criteria.
