**ChatGPT does not represent AI. AI in biology means very different things.**

The popular narrative around artificial intelligence today revolves around **AGI**—Artificial General Intelligence—systems that can perform many diverse tasks across domains. ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are often framed this way.

**But AI in biological research is fundamentally ASI—Artificial Specific Intelligence, not AGI.**

Why? Because **biology is fundamentally different from settled domains**. There is still too much unknown. New discoveries emerge constantly—novel cell types, unexpected regulatory mechanisms, unanticipated protein functions, surprising disease pathways. The biological knowledge base is not static. It is expanding rapidly, and much of it remains uncharted.

This makes AI in biology inherently specific by nature. General-purpose AI trained on existing knowledge cannot simply be deployed to biological problems. Each biological question requires models that **adapt to what has not yet been discovered**, that incorporate emerging findings, and that are customized to unique constraints and contexts.

## What Defines AI in Biology as ASI?

AI for biological research is inherently **specific and context-dependent**. Every successful biological AI model exhibits these characteristics:

- Tailored to **novel, non-shareable datasets** unique to each biological question
- Incorporates **deep domain understanding** of biological principles
- Adapts to specialized data types—single-cell RNA-seq, proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, imaging, clinical phenotypes
- Works with **limited labeled data** and domain-specific constraints
- Requires **interpretability** and mechanistic transparency

These are not optional features that could make a model better. They are **essential properties** that define what it means to do AI in biology. This is why AI in biological research is ASI by nature, not a scaled-down version of AGI.

## What This Means for PIs: Be Specific in Your Questions

Because AI in biology is ASI, **PIs should be empowered—and expected—to ask highly specific questions** about any model they encounter or consider using:

- **What exactly was this model trained on?**  
  What datasets? What organisms? What cell types? What conditions? What timepoints?

- **What biological assumptions are built into the architecture?**  
  Does it assume independence between genes? Does it account for spatial structure? Does it model temporal dynamics?

- **What is this model specifically capable of?**  
  Can it generalize to my organism, my tissue, my experimental conditions? What are the boundary conditions of its applicability?

- **What can this model NOT do?**  
  What biological contexts will break it? What kinds of novel discoveries would it miss?

- **How was validation performed?**  
  Was it tested on truly held-out data? Were the validation sets biologically similar to my question?

These are not "technical details" to be delegated. They are **scientific questions that define whether a model is appropriate for your biological problem**. If someone presents a model as a solution but cannot answer these questions clearly, that is a red flag.

In the AGI framing, asking these questions might seem like nitpicking. In the ASI reality of biological research, these questions are central to scientific rigor.
