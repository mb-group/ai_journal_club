This chapter explores the current state of foundation models in genomics, from their theoretical promise to practical reality. The content has been organized into several focused sub-chapters for easier navigation.

## Overview

Following the success of protein language models, the genomics field has adopted similar approaches to build "genomics foundation models." The promise is compelling: models that can learn fundamental patterns from massive genomic datasets and then apply this knowledge to diverse downstream tasks. However, the reality has proven more nuanced than initial excitement suggested.

## Chapter Organization

This material is divided into the following sub-chapters:
