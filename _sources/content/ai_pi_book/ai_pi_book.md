# The AI Book for PI in Biology

```{note}
**This page is incomplete and under active development.** We welcome your suggestions and feedback! Please feel free to contribute or reach out with ideas for improvement.
```



This book provides intuitive understanding and practical guidance for Principal Investigators (PIs) in biology on integrating artificial intelligence into their research programs and translating their research quesition into an AI task.


```{admonition} Target Audience
:class: info

- Principal Investigators leading biology research laboratories
- Group leaders considering AI adoption
- Senior researchers responsible for lab technology decisions
```
```{admonition} ⚠️ What Is NOT Included: Execution-Level Complexity
:class: warning

This book intentionally does not cover the technical implementation details that are typically handled by computational team members. Topics outside the scope include infrastructure setup (server configuration, GPU management, system administration), coding specifics , data preprocessing pipelines and training operations (model architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, loss function mathematics).
