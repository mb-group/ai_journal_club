# Mind Maps Gallery

## Visual Conceptual Frameworks

These mind maps represent visual summaries and conceptual frameworks that emerged from our journal club discussions. Each mind map captures key relationships, hierarchies, and connections between important AI concepts in biology, providing intuitive visual guides for understanding complex topics.

## Gallery

The following mind maps are organized by theme and represent collective insights from multiple discussion sessions:

### AI Frameworks and Methodologies

- **[AI View by Data Type](mind-maps/AI-view-by-data-type.pdf)**: Comprehensive framework organizing AI approaches by the types of biological data they process.

- **[Framework to Scrutinize Foundation Models](mind-maps/framework%20to%20scrutinize%20a%20foundation%20model.pdf)**: Systematic approach for evaluating and analyzing foundation models in biological contexts.

- **[Language Models](mind-maps/language-model.pdf)**: Conceptual overview of language models and their applications in biological sequence analysis.

- **[Interpretable AI](mind-maps/interpretable-AI.pdf)**: Framework for understanding and implementing interpretable AI methods in biological research.

### Protein-Focused AI Applications

- **[AI for Protein (Dedicated)](mind-maps/AI-for-protein_dedicated.pdf)**: Specialized AI approaches and tools designed specifically for protein analysis and prediction.

- **[Protein Design & Engineering](mind-maps/protein%20design_engineering.pdf)**: Comprehensive framework for AI-driven protein design and engineering methodologies.

### Field Development and Research Strategy

- **[Building Block Field Evolution Trajectory](mind-maps/building-block-field-evolution-trajectory.pdf)**: Mapping the evolutionary trajectory of key building blocks in AI for biology.

- **[Dry Lab - Wet Lab Synergy](mind-maps/dry-lab-wet-lab-synergy.pdf)**: Framework for optimizing collaboration between computational and experimental approaches.

- **[Using the Ecosystem for a Project](mind-maps/to-use-the-ecosystem-for-a-project.pdf)**: Strategic guide for leveraging the broader AI/biology ecosystem in research projects.

## Usage Notes

- **Interactive PDFs**: Click on any mind map to view the full-resolution version
- **Context**: Each mind map represents synthesized insights from multiple journal club discussions
- **Updates**: These mind maps are living documents that evolve as our understanding deepens
- **Themes**: Mind maps are organized by conceptual themes rather than chronological order

## Contributing

Mind maps in this gallery represent collaborative efforts from journal club participants. New mind maps are added as discussions generate novel conceptual frameworks or when existing frameworks require significant updates based on new insights.
