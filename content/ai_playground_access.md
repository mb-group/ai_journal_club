## Getting Started

To access the AI playground and start experimenting with different models, follow these steps:

### 1. Select Your Model

From the dropdown menu, select the model name you want to play with. Available models include:

- Various language models for text generation
- Protein structure prediction models  
- Molecular property prediction models
- Other specialized AI models relevant to our research

### 2. Configure Your Environment

After selecting your model:

- Choose the appropriate **GPU** configuration based on your computational needs
- Set other required entries and parameters
- Configure memory and processing requirements

### 3. Access the Environment

Once you land in the playground environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository to the appropriate folder
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

Make sure to clone the repository to the correct working directory where you plan to run your experiments.

### 4. Finding Models of Interest

To find the specific model you are interested in:

1. **Browse the Model Library**: Use the search and filter functions in the playground interface
2. **Check Documentation**: Review model descriptions and capabilities
3. **Examine Use Cases**: Look at example applications and research applications
4. **Verify Compatibility**: Ensure the model fits your research requirements

## Best Practices

- Always verify model requirements before starting
- Keep track of your experiments and configurations
- Save important results and model outputs
- Follow computational resource guidelines
- Document your workflow for reproducibility

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check GPU availability and requirements
- Verify repository permissions and access
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Contact the system administrator if needed

## Next Steps

Once you have successfully accessed the playground and set up your environment, you can begin exploring the models relevant to your research interests in protein dynamics, GPCR studies, and cellular functions.
