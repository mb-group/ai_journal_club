## PPI Interaction

### PIONEER - PPI interactome reveals proteome-wide perturbations caused by disease mutations

- **Inference stage**
  - Input: protein, protein (have structure or not, either works, of course, provide pdb if available, hopefully it will perform better with more info)
  - Output: interaction interface prediction, i.e what residues are in contact
- **GitHub**: Available
- **Paper**: Nature Biotech 2024
- **Core tech**: transfer learning to share info and maximize utilization of all available data, in sequence and structure
- **Name on playground**: `pioneer`

## Protein-Peptide Interaction

### MAPE-PPI

- **GitHub**: Available
- **Paper**: ICLR 2024 spotlight
