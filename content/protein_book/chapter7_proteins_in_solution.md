### GPCR-BERT - pivoting existing protein language to GPCR dedicated task, to understanding what PLM is learning on GPCR

- **Input**: protein sequence
- **Output**: attention scores
- **Tech highlight**: attention, using motif to do masked training, instead of random masking
- **Paper**: JCIM 2024

### PRecogx - predict all GPCR and all G-protein and beta-arrestin interaction

- **Input**: GPCR sequence
- **Output**: residue level contact prediction with G-protein and beta-arrestin
- **Paper**: NAR 2022
