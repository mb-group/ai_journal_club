Model architecture: The structure of a neural network, including layers, types (e.g., CNN, Transformer), and how data flows through it. 

Training behavior/scheme: The process of feeding labeled data to an AI model so it can learn patterns and adjust its parameters. 

Evaluation behavior/scheme: The set of methods and metrics used to assess model performance, such as accuracy, AUROC, or precision-recall. 

Inference behavior/scheme: The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. 

State-of-the-art: The most advanced or highest-performing models or techniques available in the field. 

Embedding: A numerical vector representation of complex input (e.g., protein sequences), used as input to models.
