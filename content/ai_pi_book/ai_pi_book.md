# The AI Book for PI in Biology

This book provides practical guidance for Principal Investigators (PIs) in biology on integrating artificial intelligence into their research programs.

## Overview

As AI technologies rapidly advance, biological research laboratories face both opportunities and challenges in adopting these tools. This book is designed to help PIs understand, evaluate, and implement AI solutions in their research environments.

## Target Audience

- Principal Investigators leading biology research laboratories
- Group leaders considering AI adoption
- Senior researchers responsible for lab technology decisions

## What This Book Covers

This book focuses on the strategic, managerial, and decision-making aspects of AI adoption in biological research. It is designed for PIs who need to understand AI's potential impact, make informed decisions about resources and tools, and lead their teams through AI integration.


### Orientation

- What's a model?
- Training vs. inference vs. deployment
- AI in biology vs. ChatGPT vs. AlphaFold 1/2/3

---

### Part I: When You Need a Quick Bird's-Eye View (The Center Stage)

#### Catch up on the jargons

- The must-know models
- Training, pretraining, fine-tuning, prompting, embeddings—all that jazz
- Trends/buzz/concepts vs. reality/performance/assumptions/limitations

#### Key domains

- Foundation models
- Protein language models (pLMs)
- What's already "old" vs. state-of-the-art
- Publications that made top news

---

### Part II: When You Want to Form Understanding (The Back Stage)

#### AI fundamentals at intuition level

- Core concepts without the math

#### Going deeper: Less-known but promisingly emerging subfields

- Out-of-distribution generalization
- Interpretability techniques

---

### Part III: When You're Planning to "Do It"

#### When you need something to use

- Browse by catalog: our curated collection of tools

#### When you want to design your own

- Problem formulation: translating biology questions and data into AI tasks
- The must-know techniques to make it happen

---

### Part IV: Special Topics in the Spotlight (Clarity Emerging from Chaos)

#### Case studies

- What protein language models actually learn
- Actual performance of foundation models in genomics

#### Debates and clarifications

- Why this approach, not that one?
- Must-update misconceptions (e.g., "AI only predicts correlations")
- Bias-variance tradeoff

#### Seemingly confused subfields clarified

- Domain generalization vs. transfer learning vs. meta-learning
- Interpretable vs. explainable AI vs. mechanistic interpretability



## What Is NOT Included: Execution-Level Complexity

This book intentionally does not cover the technical implementation details that are typically handled by computational team members. The following topics are outside the scope:

### Infrastructure

- Detailed server configuration and setup
- Network architecture and optimization
- GPU driver installation and management
- Container orchestration specifics
- System administration tasks

### Coding

- Programming language syntax and detailed code examples
- Algorithm implementation details
- Software development practices
- Debugging and code optimization
- Package development

### Data Preprocessing

- Specific data cleaning scripts
- Feature engineering techniques
- Data transformation pipelines
- File format conversion code
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) implementation

### Training Operations

- Model architecture design details
- Hyperparameter tuning procedures
- Training loop implementation
- Gradient descent optimization specifics
- Loss function mathematics

**Why This Approach?**

As a PI, your role is to provide strategic direction, secure resources, build teams, and ensure responsible use of AI—not to become a hands-on AI engineer. This book equips you with the knowledge to make informed decisions and effectively communicate with computational team members without requiring deep technical expertise in implementation.
