Modern AI does things that don't fit neatly into classical supervised learning:
- **Image segmentation:** Not just "what's in this image?" but "which pixels correspond to which cell?"
- **Generation:** Creating new protein sequences, predicting drug-like molecules, generating realistic microscopy images
- **Self-supervision:** Learning patterns without explicit labels by predicting parts of the data from other parts
