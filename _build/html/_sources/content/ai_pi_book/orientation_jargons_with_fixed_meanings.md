# Jargons with Community-Agreed Fixed Meanings

## Why This Matters
AI is a field far unestablished than people may assume comparing to disciplines such as physics, chemistry. You may think biology is messy and many new discoveries have not make into the textbook. We are at the age like in the first industrial revolution where steam enginees were changing the world but actually thermal dynamics was not even understood. In AI, there's not even a wildy acknolwedged textbook. Excitement today, mostly started based on new innovations after 2017. Hence it's a field where theory falls far behind emperical success. Even the success on why AlphaFold fundamental building blocks works and what protein language model actually learns is still a hot research field. This overall immatureness in contrast to its widely spread buzz lead to many "problems"
- almost all jargons are set based only community consensus without official definition. such as what's difference between ai, deep learning, machine learning, neural nets.
- it's hard for a layman to get into the field by reading. such as what's the difference between transformer, diffusion, llm.
- many questions have no clearn answer. such as why use cnn instead lstm, is transformer always better than simple layer

Here we just collect to answer frequently asked about jargons that biologists find bothering them.
