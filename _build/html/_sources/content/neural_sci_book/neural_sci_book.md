# Principles of Neural Science and AI

*Exploring AI's transformative role in understanding the nervous system and brain function*

## Overview

Neural science represents one of the most complex and fascinating frontiers in biology, where AI is making unprecedented contributions to our understanding of the brain, neural circuits, and behavior. This book explores how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing neuroscience research, from molecular mechanisms to cognitive processes.

The field of computational neuroscience has evolved dramatically with the integration of machine learning, deep neural networks, and advanced data analysis techniques. Modern AI approaches are not only modeling neural phenomena but also providing new insights into brain function, neural disorders, and potential therapeutic interventions.
