## Visual Conceptual Frameworks

These mind maps represent visual summaries and conceptual frameworks that emerged from our journal club discussions. Each mind map captures key relationships, hierarchies, and connections between important AI concepts in biology, providing intuitive visual guides for understanding complex topics.

## Gallery

The following mind maps represent collective insights from multiple discussion sessions. Click on any image to view the full PDF.
