*What's the current state of AI in fundamental biology? — A live, growing book of insight*

## Overview

With the excitement surrounding the integration of AI into every aspect of life, it's crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the areas where AI has significantly contributed to fundamental scientific research, as well as identifying gaps that remain unexplored. To address this, we've created an AI playground, a zoo of models—an accessible and interactive resource. With just a few clicks, you can gain a holistic view of AI's impact across various topics and experiment with each model to discover how truly beneficial they are.

Currently, 69 papers/models are hosted, mostly from Nature Portfolio journals in 2024 according to a selection criteria.

## Highlights

**Rapid**: Frequent, up-to-date discussions that keep pace with AI and biology's fast evolution.

**Hands-on & Interactive**: Learn by doing — live demos, code walkthroughs, and collaborative exploration.

**Break & Play**: Deconstruct cutting-edge models, experiment beyond the manuscript, and re-create results together.

**Cross-field Overview**: Integrate perspectives across data modalities and disciplines to spark new insights.

**Accelerate Translation**: Shorten the cycle from fundamental discovery to clinical impact.

## Model catalog rationale

Models are organized according to classic textbooks (Proteins, Genes, The Cell) chapters and topics to reflect how much AI has been contributing to fundamental science. See [selection criteria](content/selection_criteria.md) for details of what publications are included.

**P.S.** Model descriptions are being completed gradually according to the pace of the journal club. If any paper particularly interests you, please feel free to tell us to prioritize them.
